Q1: Why might we consider using git?

Answer: Allows for parallel development and remote access to files with easy sharing between users.
Branches allow organized, isolated development enviornments.
Remote access means files can be accessed on any system.
Easy handling of merges and collisions.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science could be applied to government transportation initiatives. When trying to design bus routes, there is an interest in optimizing many factors,
including accessibility for for those who would benefit from public transit, fuel consuption, commute times, etc. All of these factors need lots of data including
housing, income, commute methods, traffic patterns, etc. On the large scale implementations of public transit that the government is investing in, there is a
serious financial interest, and taxpayer interest, in optimized routes.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging combines changes from two brances into a single commit that includes both of their content (or not, per user discretion) and maintains their unique
history. Rebasing, alternatively, merges the history of the branches into a single, linear one. This is nicer for clarity and simplifies the branch structure of the
lineage but can be more difficult to manage if history is lost/overwritten.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: Knowledge of git for real world development experience. I hope to understand common ways big data is used and interpreted in order to understand what happens
with big data in industry even if I can't always understand the nuances of how that data is managed. Ie I want to gain the skills to be able to consistently have
a high level understanding of data across industries and companies by learning how to learn.
